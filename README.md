Welcome to the cutAbove wiki!

Background and Overview
As the COVID 19 pandemic starts to alleviate, people are entering a new normal. A big part of this normal? The lack of proper hair styling that people have had to endure during that time. 

But many people may have moved around during the pandemic, or want to try a different hairstyle with their extra hair. Introducing, cutAbove.

A new service that connects hairstylists and clients, cutAbove will bridge the divide and uncertainty that previously made haircuts a stressor.

The service will feature two profile types, clients and stylists.

Client profiles will allow users to ask questions and send pictures of their haircuts directly to their stylists ahead of time, helping stylists with a reference point for more than a few seconds before they start working. Stylists will also be able to post photos of their best work to attract clients. They can also send messages to their stylists. Clients will also be able to book appointments with individual stylists.

Stylists will be able to upload pictures of their best work to their profiles, converse with clients through the messaging service, and receive reviews on their work. Given time, we would also like to implement a map service so clients can see which barbers are in their vicinity.

Functionality and MVP

userAuth - Able to create a basic user profile that can login/logout, bootstrapped to the window

stylistAuth - Differentiate between the two different types of profiles, client and stylist. Clients will be able to create appointments, upload photos for that appointment, message stylists.
Stylists will be able to upload pictures of their best work to their profile

appointments - Client can schedule an appointment, upload photos for that appointment
messaging - Client can message the stylist about the upcoming appointment (someone else will need to fill this in - Diego's idea but not sure of the intent)
reviews - Clients can give a review of the stylist, ideally only once the appointment with the hairstylist has occurred.
